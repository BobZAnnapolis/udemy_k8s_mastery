Updating Load Balancer configuration
------------------------------------
- we would like to remove a pod from the load balancer
- what would happen if we removed that pod, with kubectl delete pod...?
  - it would be re-created immediately (by the replica set or the daemon set)
    - as currently configured
  - need to modify if in production, testing, etc

- what would happen if we removed the app=rng label from that pod ?
  - it would also be re-created immedaitely

- why ?
  - the "mission" of a replica set is :
    - "Make sure that there is the right number of pods matching the spec"
  - the "mission" of a daemon set is :
    - "Make sure that there is a pod matching the spec on each node"
