Section 04. Installing K8s for Learning
=======================================

- Best : Get an environment locally
  - Docker Desktop : MAC
  - small setup effort; free flexible environments
  - requires 2GB+ of memory

- Good : Set up a cloud Linux host to run microk8s
  - great if you don't have the local resources to run K8s
  - small setup effort, only free for a while

- last choice : Use a browser-based solution
  - low setup effort, but host is short-lived & has limited resources
  - not all hands-on examples will work in a browser sandbox


K8s With Docker Desktop {MAC}
=============================
- great for local dev / test setup
- requires modern macOS
- install
- go into Settings
  - Kubernetes
    - check "Enable Kubernetes"
